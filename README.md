# Chomsky-language-conversion
This project has the following capabilities:  
1) Any grammar can be converted to Chomsky grammar.  
2) Can delete Landa in grammar.  
3) Can remove useless rules.  
4) can delete the one rule.  

This program is written in the Java language. 
It is recommended to run in Eclipse IDE for better performance.  

Notes: 
Use "%" instead of Landa. 
This app will make a Trash-File.txt that you can delete after a run or review it to know the steps. 
Write your grammar in the .txt file and choose it in the program.  
If you have a problem or If you can not run on any operating system except Windows just email me.
